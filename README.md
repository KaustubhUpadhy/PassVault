## Core Features

### Password Generation & Analysis
- **Cryptographically Secure Generation**: Uses Web Crypto API with configurable complexity (12â€“50 characters)  
- **Advanced Strength Analysis**: Real-time `zxcvbn` algorithm implementation with entropy calculations  
- **Breach Detection**: Integration with **HaveIBeenPwned API** using k-anonymity for privacy protection  
- **Personal Context Awareness**: Analyzes passwords against personal information to detect vulnerabilities  

### Zero-Knowledge Cloud Storage
- **Client-Side Encryption**: AES-256-GCM encryption before cloud storage  
- **Zero-Knowledge Architecture**: Server cannot decrypt user passwords  
- **Cross-Device Sync**: Encrypted vault accessible from any device  
- **Secure Search**: Encrypted search functionality across stored passwords  

### Security Intelligence
- **Comprehensive Security Reports**: Automated analysis of entire password vault  
- **Breach Monitoring**: Real-time checking of stored passwords against breach databases  
- **Strength Distribution Analytics**: Visual breakdown of password security levels  
- **Personalized Recommendations**: AI-driven suggestions for security improvements  

### Enterprise Authentication
- **Multi-Provider OAuth**: Google, GitHub integration via Supabase Auth  
- **Password Reset Flow**: Secure email-based password recovery  
- **Session Management**: JWT-based authentication with automatic refresh  
- **Row-Level Security**: Database-level access control
